# Android-BasicWeatherApplication---kart
weather android app

This is a basic android weather application. 
I created it to explore android development further.
It uses the free OpenWeatherMap api and uses JSON objects for communication with the server.
The app gets the user's location (manually or via GPS) and sends this information to the server.
It receives a JSON response from the server which it unmarshalls and renders to the user.

It can also display the forecast for the next three days.
